LTI - LTI’s designer, IMS Global Learning Consortium
“Learning Tools Interoperability® (LTI®) is a specification developed by IMS Global Learning Consortium2...the principal concept of LTI is to establish a standard way of integrating rich learning applications (often remotely hosted and provided through third-party services) with platforms like learning management systems, portals, learning object repositories, or other educational environments. In LTI these learning applications are called Tools (delivered by Tool Providers), and the LMS, or platforms, are called Tool Consumers. The basic use case behind the development of the LTI specification is to allow the seamless connection of web-based, externally hosted applications and content, or Tools, to platforms that present them to users.”
